# CruzHacks 2021 Design Challenge

Welcome to the Design Challenge! You may complete one of the two options below. Choose your own adventure:
* **Option A:** hero image
* **Option B:** flyer

## Option A: Hero Image

* **Objective:** create a hero image for the CruzHacks 2021 website. 

> In web design, a hero image is a large web banner image, prominently placed 
> on a web page, generally in the front and center. The hero image is often 
> the first visual element a visitor encounters on the site; it presents an 
> overview of the site's most important content. 

Essentially, this is the first thing potential hackers/sponsors would see when visiting the CruzHacks website. 

Here is an example of a hero we considered using for 2019: [Hero Example](./design-assets/hero-example.png)

This is just a challenge to exercise your creative skills - have fun with it!

## Option B: Flyer

* **Objective:** create a promotional flyer for CruzHacks 2021.

> Posting flyers on bulletin boards and campus bus stops is a simple but surprisingly effective marketing strategy. 
> A memorable flyer has a strong visual identity, a cohesive aesthetic, and a good balance of information - 
> enough to be informative without being overwhelming. 

You can find some examples of CruzHacks 2020 flyer designs in the [design assets subdirectory](./design-assets).
