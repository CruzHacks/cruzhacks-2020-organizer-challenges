# CruzHacks 2022 Engineering
## Director Challenge

As an engineering director, it is imperative that you are familiar with the entire stack of the website you will plan to build. Failure to be familiar with either side of the stack will result in backend database vulnerabilites when building an in-house application portal or a UI that is only optimized for desktop users and lacks responsiveness across all screen dimensions.

For the challenge, we would like to see how well you can build a full stack web application. We are not expecting an entirely new social media app or the new and improved search engine that will take over Google. The full stack web application can use any desired stack as long as it adheres to the following criteria:

1. Must make use of 2 basic CRUD operations
   * POST (C)
   * GET (R)
2. Must display a simple form in the UI that creates a Hacker and shows the Hackers already in the database
   * You can do this by creating a simple React app or use any language and framework of choice (although a React front end has been used in the prior years)

Extra brownie points if your backend endpoints are hosted online and we can ping a live endpoint, although that is not a requirement. If you'd like to host your site online, take a peek at how to do so with Firebase. They provide really neat step-by-step documents that will allow you to host everything on there.

We will be mostly looking to see how well you can navigate the entire stack. Please try and write clean and concise code as that will also be taken into consideration. Again, we are not expecting you to be experts with either side of the stack. Most importantly, have fun with this!

## Submission
Please email your submission to dev@cruzhacks.com and CC the UCSC Presidents @ exec@cruzhacks.com, who will be reviewing your submissions. Any and all questions should be directed to those emails. Either submit a zip file containing your code and a README document or send us a link to your Github Repo directly.

These submissions will be due in two week on March 14th by midnight. Please let us know if you have any further questions.

### README
Your README document can used as a place to tell us how to run your code locally and also to tell us a little about your process, what went well, what didn't, etc. Please make use of this space as we will take all of the submitted documents into consideration when reviewing submissions.
