# CruzHacks 2021 Backend Engineering Challenge

In this exercise, weâ€™re asking you to create a [REST API](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest) that supports the application portal created in the frontend challenge.  

**NOTE**: This year, we will be using Firebase to host and deploy our site and functions. We are asking all applicants to create and deploy their functions via [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Challenge

Your task is to create a series of API endpoints that perform basic [CRUD (Create, Read, Update)](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud) operations for a simple application portal. The application database will consist of hacker documents, which stores hacker information. You are expected to create API endpoints that supports POST, PUT, and GET requests.

* POST will create a hacker document in your database
* PUT will update your hacker's data
* GET will retreieve that information and display it in your appliacation portal until it's been submitted. Information should not be able to be updated once submit has been pressed.

## Database Schema

Your database schema should follow the application portal's fields. Form validation should be covered client side, but fields inside each hacker object need to meet their respective constraints. Please refer to this [schema](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPo9_31LTOIkPMnFt-n4zWBOg7HsOB-yEDPmuAKsM6I/edit) when creating your database.

As mentioned, our team will be using Firebase this year, so we ask that your database also be hosted on Firebase as well. For the application portal, we will be using the [Cloud Firestore Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

### Security Rules

Security is something we take very seriously, especially when it comes to hacker data. Please set your [security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) to allow for authenticated users only. This means you have to pass in an authentication token when you create a request to your backend.

### Sample Responses

Your completed program should be fully functional and provide appropriate responses when tested with actual API requests.

For example, the following request:

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:applicaton/json" -H "token:A89asbsadf88AS*9f" http://[projectID].cloudfunctions.net/getHackerInfo -d '{"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe:}'`

Will create a hacker document in your hacker database with John Doe's information inside that document. It might return JSON similar to:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "Succesful post to database"
}

OR

{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Unable to add user to database"
}
```

Keep in mind this is an example for one endpoint, your completed program should have enough endpoints that allow for full CRUD functionality on the hacker object.

## Things to Consider

As software engineers, being able to write and implement code is half the solution to a problem. Testing allows us to prove that our code meets expectations, so we can catch errors before shipping to the public. Using [Mocha and Firebase's testing suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/unit-testing), we would like you to perform [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) that debug your functions.

## Submission

Don't be discouraged if you struggle with some portions of the challenge. Try your best to tackle each problem as it is presented! You will have the the opportunity to learn more & hone your skills if you show commitment throughout this challenge.

### How To Submit

* Create a public Github repo with your project. [If you're unfamiliar with Git, this will get you running.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/)
  * Include a Readme with your API endpoints
* Email a link of your repo to [contact@cruzhacks.com](mailto:contact@cruzhacks.com) with the subject line `CruzHacks Challenge - Last, First`
  * Please also submit a .txt file with your [authentication token](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/use-rest-api#working_with_firebase_id_tokens) **if the Firebase security rules have been left default**.
  * If you are also attempting the frontend challenge, please attach a link to that second repository in the same email.

Best of luck and we'll get back to you all a few weeks after the deadline!
